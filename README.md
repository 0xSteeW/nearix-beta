# Nearix-beta

This bot still works for some pokecord clones. Not guaranteed to work with all, and its not 100% effective in the catches (but still has a very high rate). Catching is being improved.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any bans or blacklists.

To use this bot simply download the executable that fits your OS from https://github.com/0xSteeW/nearix-beta/releases
