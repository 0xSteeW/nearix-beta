# Nearix-beta

This bot still works for some pokecord clones. Not guaranteed to work with all, and its not 100% effective in the catches (but still has a very high rate). Catching is being improved.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any bans or blacklists.

To use this bot simply download the executable that fits your OS from https://github.com/0xSteeW/nearix-beta/releases

Last update: 12/09/2020

How to set up:
Double click the executable that you downloaded (called something like nearix-beta-youros-64) and input everything the bot asks. After than, open in any browser the following webpage: http://localhost:9898/settings .
To enable catching in a server, click the red square next to the server name, in the middle menu. To enable spam, click on the red square in the rightmost column, next to the channel name where you want to spam in. To disable, click the same square.
