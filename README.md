# Update: You can use this app for some pokecord-like bots like PokeRealm. Just edit config/config.yaml and change "pokecordid" to the specific bot's ID. This is not guaranteed to work with other bots.

Just download the latest release from here: https://github.com/0xSteeW/nearix-beta/releases

Setup:
Download the release that fits your operating system (ex.: windows-amd64 for 64 bit windows). If your operating system or architecture is not on the list please contact me so I  can build it for you.

For launching the program just open the executable you downloaded (ex.: nearix-windows-amd64.exe) and proceed with the setup.
